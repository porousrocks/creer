# CREER dataset

**CREER**  (**C**orpus for **R**elation **E**xtraction and **E**ntity **R**ecognition) is a large corpus annotated with rich English grammar and semantic attributes. It was proposed in our work [CREER: A Large-Scale Corpus for Relation Extraction and Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12710.pdf). The CREER dataset uses the Stanford CoreNLP Annotator to capture rich language structures from Wikipedia plain text, and this large supervised dataset can be used for most NLP tasks. The dataset is publicized through the link:[https://140.116.82.111/share.cgi?ssid=000dOJ4](https://140.116.82.111/share.cgi?ssid=000dOJ4)

## Download file

The dataset provides (1) all entity mentions and relation KBP in a sentence, as well as (2) tokens, parse trees, and dependency tokens for parts of the Wikipedia corpus.

Thus, if you want to access only entity mentions and relation KBP in a sentence, please try [https://140.116.82.111/share.cgi?ssid=000dOJ4#000dOJ4/entityRelation.zip](https://140.116.82.111/share.cgi?ssid=000dOJ4#000dOJ4/entityRelation.zip)


Or, if you want to download all annotated properties in the sentence, 
You can directly download the dataset through the the link: please try [https://140.116.82.111/share.cgi?ssid=000dOJ4#000dOJ4/linguistic_data ](https://140.116.82.111/share.cgi?ssid=000dOJ4#000dOJ4/linguistic_data )
